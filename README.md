## Description
This fullstack application was created with the thought in mind to make a single place to store the movies that you want to watch, while also allowing you to also be aware of the applications where the movie is stored. In addition to this, this application allows one to add movies to the list of what is available, so the community can constantly increase the list of movies that is available to you.


## Installation
  One should be able to go to heroku and use it directly with no issues at the following link: [movie](https://movie-galleries.herokuapp.com/)

## Usage
  Primary usage would be either the update of movies on your "To Watch" list, as well as adding movies to the in application list, for others to watch as well.
